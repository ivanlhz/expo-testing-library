# expo-testing-library
This is an example project using expo, typescript and testing-library.

There is a problem with @expo/vector-icons. I tried to solve it adding `expo-font|@unimodules|@expo/vector-icons|expo-asset|expo-constants|expo-file-system` into the transformIgnorePatterns in jest.config.js but still doesn't work rightly.ðŸ˜•
